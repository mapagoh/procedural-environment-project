PROCEDURAL ENVIRONMENT PROJECT REPORT
Analize the Procedural Environment Project, which consists in the analysis of Birds at around world, the investigation her have, the years in the done the investigation, titles of the investigation, that type of species are they, and so on. This allows us to have a broader vision to proceed with the data analysis.

This project is done in programming language Python and SQL, libraries as Pandas, NumPy and Matplot, and Planet Scale for host the database in the cloud.


####	crosslinkage_table

In the following graph it can be seen that in the cross-linking of species, there are birds that meet up to 4 times in different seasons of the year and their reproduction can be varied.

In this graph you can see the correlation between points 2.0 and 3.0 with respect to the previous graph, because they have a similar trend since this graph shows us the species found in the EU.

#### data_bgmeasures

It is observed that there are sites where up to 3 publications of articles related to bird studies are made.

 ![](/images/Imagen3.png)

It can be deduced that the years with the most publications of articles related to the study of birds are 2010 and 2011.

#### data_bgmonitoring

This graph indicates that there are some monitoring that have been carried out with the same name in different years, this in order to know the current status of the birds and take the necessary actions.

#### data_birds_check_list

This graph presents the countries that have carried out studies on birds. These studies represent the importance and respect they give to nature and serve to keep track of these species.

 ![](/images/Imagen8.png)

This graph is related to the previous one because it represents the species with the most studies in different countries.

 ![](/images/Imagen9.png)

This graph is related to the previous one since they have a similar trend and this graph presents the assessments of species in the EU.

#### data_birds_eu_status

Taking into account the graph, it can be seen that the season in which the state of the birds is most present is in B.

 ![](/images/Imagen11.png)

From this graph it can be deduced that a large part of the bird population is secure.

 ![](/images/Imagen12.png)

The most found population size unit with 400 units is P.

#### data_birds

This graph presents the countries that have carried out studies on birds.

 ![](/images/Imagen14.png)

The most found population size unit with 1600 about units is P.

 ![](/images/Imagen15.png)

Taking into account the graph, it can be seen that the time when birds can be observed and monitored the most is in B.

 ![](/images/Imagen16.png)

This graph presents the sub-units where the majority of bird species are found.

#### species_birds_maes_EU27

This chart presents the number of bird species that can be found in the EU27 region.
 
![](/images/Imagen18.png)

This graph shows us that most of the bird species are found in areas with little vegetation.
