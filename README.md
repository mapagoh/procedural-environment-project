## PROCEDURAL ENVIRONMENT PROJECT REPORT

Analize the Procedural Environment Project, which consists in the analysis of Birds at around world, the investigation her have, the years in the done the investigation, titles of the investigation, that type of species are they, and so on. This allows us to have a broader vision to proceed with the data analysis.

This project is done in programming language Python and SQL, libraries as Pandas, NumPy and Matplot, and Planet Scale for host the database in the cloud.


####	crosslinkage_table

In the following graph it can be seen that in the cross-linking of species, there are birds that meet up to 3 times in different seasons of the year and their reproduction can be varied.

In this graph you can see the correlation between points 2.0 and 3.0 with respect to the previous graph, because they have a similar trend since this graph shows us the species found in the EU.

#### data_bgmeasures

It is observed that there are sites where up to 2 publications are made on the same site or bookstore of articles related to bird studies. Which is important to keep the community informed of the measures, variations and their status.

 <img src="/images/i3.JPG" style="width: 260px">

It can be deduced that the year with the most publications of articles related to the study of birds is 2011, with up to 14 publications of the same project with its different advances throughout the year.

#### data_bgmonitoring

This graph indicates that there are some monitoring that have been carried out with the same name in different years, this in order to know the current state of the birds and take the necessary actions for their reproduction, feeding, etc.

#### data_bgpublication


It is observed that the year with the highest publication of articles on bird research is between 2008 and 2010. This may indicate that there was more interest in the study of birds in these years, since they are important for dispersal and pollination.

#### data_bgreport

In all the years presented in the graph, reports on national bird atlases are presented, it can be deduced that these publications are constant over the years.

<img src="/images/i7.JPG" style="width: 260px">

Continuing with the previous graph, in every year there were national birds in danger of extinction or red list, these investigations were carried out constantly through the years and it can be deduced that there was not a year more altered than another in this condition for the birds.

#### data_birds_check_list

This graph presents the countries that have carried out studies on birds. These studies represent the importance and respect they give to nature and serve to keep track of these species.

<img src="/images/i9.JPG" style="width: 260px">

This graph is related to the previous one because it represents the species with the most studies carried out in different countries.

 <img src="/images/i10.JPG" style="width: 260px">

This graph is related to the previous one since they have a similar trend and this graph presents the assessments of species in the EU.

 <img src="/images/i11.JPG" style="width: 260px">

#### data_birds_eu_breeding_trends

Taking into account the graph of population size unit trends in the EU, it can be seen that the most representative population is P.

<img src="/images/i12.JPG" style="width: 260px">

#### data_birds_eu_status

Taking into account the graph, it can be seen that the season in which the state of the birds is most present is in B.

<img src="/images/i13.JPG" style="width: 260px">

From this graph it can be deduced that a large part of the bird population is in safe conditions. It follows that their cycle is normal and that there are no alterations in the ecosystem where they are found.

<img src="/images/i14.JPG" style="width: 260px">

The most commonly found population size unit of up to 400 units is P.

#### data_bpressures_threats

This graph shows the values that exert the most pressure on birds.

 <img src="/images/i16.JPG" style="width: 260px">

The most widely used classification code in threat pressure is M.

  <img src="/images/i17.JPG" style="width: 260px">

#### data_birds

This graph represents the countries that have carried out studies on birds, in this case Austria and Ireland.

 <img src="/images/i18.JPG" style="width: 260px">

This graph represents the name of the most studied and found species in the aforementioned countries.

 <img src="/images/i19.JPG" style="width: 260px">

 TThis graph presents the subunits where the mentioned birds are found.

 <img src="/images/i20.JPG" style="width: 260px">

 There are certain birds that are more common to find than others, in this there are almost birds that are found in the mentioned countries and it is constantly.

 <img src="/images/i21.JPG" style="width: 260px">

#### species_birds_maes_EU27

This chart presents the number of bird species that can be found in the EU27 region.
 
 <img src="/images/i22.JPG" style="width: 260px">


This graph shows that most bird species are found in areas of rivers lakes. This is important, since in most areas with rivers lakes there is a lot of vegetation and it is easier for birds to find food and shelter.

 <img src="/images/i23.JPG" style="width: 260px">

This graph presents the subunits where the majority of bird species are found.
